**September 2020** Paper on [**Improving Neural Topic Models using Knowledge Distillation**](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.137.pdf) accepted as a long paper at EMNLP 2020! Joint work with Alexander Hoyle (we are both first authors) and Philip Resnik.

**August 2020** We got an NSF grant for our idea and planned project on Modeling Co-Decisions: A Computational Framework Using Language and Metadata [(story)](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/about-us/news/resnik-developing-computational-models-better-understand-how-decisions-are-made).

**June 2020 - August 2020** Research Internship at MSR, Redmond with [Nebojsa Jojic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jojic/) at the [NLP Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/).

About Me
======

I am a budding Computer Scientist excited by research lying at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science. I am a fourth-year **Ph.D.** student at the [**University of Maryland**](https://www.umd.edu/) in the [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/pgoel1) program doing **NLP** research at the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing ([**CLIP**](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page)) lab. I am currently working on multiple exciting projects with **my advisor [Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/)**, including text-as-data applications in computational political science, understanding misinformation narratives, and improving topic model evaluation and their ability to assist practitioners. My collaborations over these projects include the Microsoft Research, the Department of Government and Politics at UMD, and the [Lazer Lab](https://lazerlab.net/) at Northeastern University. I finished my Bachelors in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) from [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2018, and completed my Master's in CS at UMD in 2020. 

[//]: # (My undergraduate advisor at IIT (BHU) Varanasi was [Prof. Anil Kumar Singh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/aksinghcse), with whom I explored sentiment and emotion anaylsis, and story ending prediction among a host of other topics. I also worked as a research intern with [Dr. Aditya Joshi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~adityaj/) and [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) at the [CFILT Lab](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/), Indian Insitute of Technology Bombay on computational sarcasm in summer 2016, as a software engineering intern with the Data Science team of [Ephesoft, India](https://www.ephesoft.com/) on content analysis in winter 2016, and as a research intern with [Dr. Yoichi Matsuyama](http://www.yoichimatsuyama.com/) and [Prof. Justine Cassell](http://www.justinecassell.com/) at the [Articulab](http://articulab.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University on conversational strategy identification (as a component of an embodied conversational agent) in summer 2017. I worked on conversational agents and chatbots with [Nebojsa Jojic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jojic/) in the NLP research group at Micrsoft Research, Redmond in summer 2019, and on computational political science with Nebojsa during summer 2020 with the collaboration continuing currently with Philip and [Kris Miller](https://cdce.umd.edu/facultyprofile/miler/kris).) 

Over the past year, I have been getting more and more interested in computational social science starting with applications in computational political science and understanding misinformation, with the social phenomenon of _framing_, including agenda-setting, a connective thread. I am (eventually) looking to delve into how to make sure NLP systems do not help create and maintain social hierarchies and systemic biases that pervade our society (much like we know *language* can and does) and instead look at ways NLP and computational linguistic analyses can be part of the solution (just like language can) - and acknowledging that sometimes the right thing to do is not to think about improving but scraping the technological 'solution' or tool. 

I am lucky to have worked with many amazing people on extremely interesting topics and I look forward to exploring more!

I grew up in [New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi), India.
