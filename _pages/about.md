About Me
======

**I am on the Academic Job Market in Fall 2025! I specialize in Computational Social Science, Text-as-Data applications, and Natural Language Processing.**

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at Northeastern University's Network Science Institute with [David Lazer](https://www.lazerlab.net/people/david-lazer) as my advisor. I recently defended my PhD thesis at the [**University of Maryland**](https://www.umd.edu/) in the [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/pgoel1) program, working with colleagues at the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing ([**CLIP**](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page)) lab, advised by **[Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/)**. My research interests span **computational social science & natural language processing**, including text-as-data applications in computational political science, analyzing framing in news and social media, understanding misinformation narratives, and improving topic model evaluation and their ability to assist practitioners. My collaborations over these projects include Microsoft Research, the Department of Government and Politics at UMD, and the [Lazer Lab](https://lazerlab.net/) at Northeastern University. I finished my Bachelors in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) from [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2018, and completed my Master's in CS at UMD in 2020.  

Over the past year, I have been getting more and more interested in computational social science starting with applications in computational political science and understanding misinformation, with the social phenomenon of _framing_, including agenda-setting, a connective thread. My dissertation is titled: **Analyzing communicative choices to understand their motivations, context-based variation, and social consequences**. I am (eventually) looking to delve into how to make sure NLP systems do not help create and maintain social hierarchies and systemic biases that pervade our society (much like we know *language* can and does) --- which requires understanding and collaboration in social sciences. I want to examine ways NLP and computational linguistics can be part of the solution (just like language can) with the understanding that sometimes the right thing to do is not to think about improving but scraping the technological 'solution' or tool. 

I am lucky to have worked with many amazing people on extremely interesting topics and I look forward to exploring more!

I grew up in New Delhi, India.
