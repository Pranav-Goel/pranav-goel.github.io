About Me
======

**I am on the Academic Job Market in Fall 2025, for positions in Fall 2026! I specialize in Computational Social Science, Text-as-Data applications, and Natural Language Processing.**

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Research Associate** at Northeastern University's Network Science Institute with [David Lazer](https://www.lazerlab.net/people/david-lazer) as my advisor. I defended my PhD thesis at the [**University of Maryland**](https://www.umd.edu/) in the [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/pgoel1) program, working with colleagues at the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing ([**CLIP**](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page)) lab, advised by **[Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/)**. My research interests span **computational social science & natural language processing**, using web and text data as a potent digital trace of societal dynamics. 

I am currently primarily interested in building a cross-platform understanding of online information consumption and investigating the impact of generative AI on information-seeking behavior. My past work has focused on analyzing framing in news and social media, understanding misinformation narratives, investigating American congressional politics such as the impact of donors on agenda-setting in floor speeches and inequality in online representation, and improving topic modeling evaluation and its ability to assist practitioners. My doctoral dissertation was titled: **Analyzing communicative choices to understand their motivations, context-based variation, and social consequences**. 

I am lucky to have worked with many amazing people on extremely interesting topics, and I look forward to exploring more!

I grew up in New Delhi, India.
