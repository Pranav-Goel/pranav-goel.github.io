**September 2020** Paper on **Improving Neural Topic Models using Knowledge Distillation** accepted as a long paper at EMNLP 2020! Joint work with Alexander Hoyle (we are both first authors) and Philip Resnik.

**August 2020** We got an NSF grant for our idea and planned project on Modeling Co-Decisions: A Computational Framework Using Language and Metadata [(story)](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/about-us/news/resnik-developing-computational-models-better-understand-how-decisions-are-made).

**June 2020 - August 2020** Research Internship at MSR, Redmond with [Nebojsa Jojic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jojic/) at the [NLP Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/natural-language-processing/).

About Me
======

I am a budding Computer Scientist excited by research lying at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning (and lately Computational Social Science). I am a second-year **Ph.D.** student at the [**University of Maryland**](https://www.umd.edu/) in the [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/pgoel1) program doing **NLP** research at the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing ([**CLIP**](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page)) lab. I am currently looking at the role of Language in Computational Political Science with **my advisor [Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/)**. I finished my Bachelors in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) from [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2018.

My undergraduate advisor at IIT (BHU) Varanasi was [Prof. Anil Kumar Singh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/aksinghcse), with whom I explored sentiment and emotion anaylsis, and story ending prediction among a host of other topics. I also worked as a research intern with [Dr. Aditya Joshi](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~adityaj/) and [Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~pb/) at the [CFILT Lab](http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/), Indian Insitute of Technology Bombay on computational sarcasm in summer 2016, as a software engineering intern with the Data Science team of [Ephesoft, India](https://www.ephesoft.com/) on content analysis in winter 2016, and as a research intern with [Dr. Yoichi Matsuyama](http://www.yoichimatsuyama.com/) and [Prof. Justine Cassell](http://www.justinecassell.com/) at the [Articulab](http://articulab.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/), Carnegie Mellon University on conversational strategy identification (as a component of an embodied conversational agent) in summer 2017. I worked on conversational agents and chatbots with [Nebojsa Jojic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jojic/) in the NLP research group at Micrsoft Research, Redmond in summer 2019, and on computational political science with Nebojsa during summer 2020 with the collaboration continuing currently with Philip and [Kris Miller](https://cdce.umd.edu/facultyprofile/miler/kris). 

Recently, I am getting more and more interested in computational social science starting with applications in computational political science. I am (eventually) looking to delve into how to make sure NLP systems do not help create and maintain social hierarchies and systemic biases that pervade our society (much like we know *language* can and does) and instead look at ways NLP and computational linguistic analyses can be part of the solution (just like language can) - and acknowledging that sometimes the right thing to do is not to think about improving but scraping the technological 'solution' or tool. 

I am lucky to have worked with many amazing people on extremely interesting topics and I look forward to exploring more!

I grew up in [New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi), India.
