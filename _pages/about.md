**June 12, 2023** I successfully defended my PhD thesis on "Analyzing communicative choices to understand their motivations, context-based variation, and social consequences"! #PhDone

**June 8, 2023** Our work, "Mainstream News Articles Co-Shared with Fake News Buttress Misinformation Narratives", accepted at ICWSM 2023 (non-archival track) and presented in Cyprus, has been awarded the [**Outstanding Study Design**](https://twitter.com/icwsm/status/1667140733453606914) award. (preprint: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06459](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06459))


About Me
======

I am a research scientist, who just defended his PhD thesis at the [**University of Maryland**](https://www.umd.edu/) in the [**Computer Science**](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/pgoel1) program doing **Computational Social Science** and **NLP** research at the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing ([**CLIP**](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page)) lab. I am currently working on multiple exciting projects with **my advisor [Philip Resnik](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~resnik/)**, including text-as-data applications in computational political science, understanding misinformation narratives, and improving topic model evaluation and their ability to assist practitioners. My collaborations over these projects include Microsoft Research, the Department of Government and Politics at UMD, and the [Lazer Lab](https://lazerlab.net/) at Northeastern University. I finished my Bachelors in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse) from [Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2018, and completed my Master's in CS at UMD in 2020. 

In Fall 2023, I will start a postdoctoral position at Northeastern University's Network Science Institute with David Lazer as my advisor, as part of the [Lazer Lab](https://lazerlab.net/). 

Over the past year, I have been getting more and more interested in computational social science starting with applications in computational political science and understanding misinformation, with the social phenomenon of _framing_, including agenda-setting, a connective thread. My dissertation is titled: **Analyzing communicative choices to understand their motivations, context-based variation, and social consequences**. I am (eventually) looking to delve into how to make sure NLP systems do not help create and maintain social hierarchies and systemic biases that pervade our society (much like we know *language* can and does) --- which requires understanding and collaborations in social sciences. I want to examine ways NLP and computational linguistics can be part of the solution (just like language can) with the understanding that sometimes the right thing to do is not to think about improving but scraping the technological 'solution' or tool. 

I am lucky to have worked with many amazing people on extremely interesting topics and I look forward to exploring more!

I grew up in New Delhi, India.
